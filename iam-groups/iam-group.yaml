  Purpose:
    Description: "This template is used to create a stack that implements a single IAM Group.  The group can 
                  be associated with one of several Manged Policies offered by AWS.  Each managed policy maps
                  to a traditional user job function/role. The stack exports both the group name and ARN on successful 
                  deployment."
